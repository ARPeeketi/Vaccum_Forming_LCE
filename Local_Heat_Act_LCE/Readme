To simulate the localized heat-induced deformation of the LCE hemisphere doped with azo-benzene, we implemented a non-uniform  thermo-mechanical strain on the hemisphere (height 23 mm, radius 20 mm), with the maximum strain applied to the illuminated side and zero strain on the other half. Additionally, a pressure-type load, equivalent to the pressure exerted by the water in the LCE bowl (≈ 156 Pa), is imposed on the inner surface of the hemisphere. The influence of the elastomer’s self-weight is also taken into consideration. A ring on the bottom side of hemisphere at a radius of 10 mm is pinned to simulate the boundary condition of placing of the LCE bowl on a stand.
