Model 1: Simulation of the vacuum thermoforming process:
To determine the local stretch and the resultant alignment in the vacuum formed LCE hemisphere, we conducted simulations of the vacuum forming process using the commercial finite element software, Abaqus. The initial flat LCE is modelled as a 500 Î¼m thick flat square film. A circular segment with a 20 mm radius is subjected to an incrementally applied pressure load, as illustrated in Figure S17. The circumference of the circle is encastered, and a hemispherical mold, modeled as a rigid body (similar to the experiments), ensures the resulting shape of the LCE resembles that of a hemisphere. The film is discretized using 3-noded S3 and 4-noded S4R shell type elements. The deformed shape is obtained by solving for a static equilibrium of the film at a given pressure load. The pressure load is systematically increased until the flat film achieves the desired hemispherical shape.
