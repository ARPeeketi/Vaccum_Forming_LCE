Model 2: Simulation of uniform heat-induced actuation of LCE hemisphere:
The thermo-mechanical deformation of the hemispherical LCE is simulated using Abaqus. The resultant shape is determined by solving for dynamic equilibrium after applying incremental spontaneous thermo-mechanical strains over time. The non-uniform thickness observed in the hemisphere (refer to Figure S5e) from the vacuum forming simulation (Model 1) is taken into account when simulating the  thermo-mechanical actuation. To account for the imperfections in the experimental hemisphere (height of 24 mm and diameter of 20 mm), the height of the hemisphere used for simulation is increased from 20 mm to 23 mm while keeping the radius as 20 mm. The edge of the hemisphere is pinned in the model. Considering the state of non-uniform bi-axial strains generated during the vacuum forming, we assumed the spontaneous t hermo-mechanical strain generated by heating from 25 °C  to 110 °C  as a function of the angle from the axis, as depicted in Figure S18. Our model assumes the elastomer to be elastically isotropic while accommodating anisotropic thermal strains. The elastic modulus of the LCE hemisphere is presumed to vary from 5 MPa at room temperature to 0.4 MPa at 110 °C.
