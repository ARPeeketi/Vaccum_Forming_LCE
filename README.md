# Vacuum_Forming_LCE
The vacuum thermoforming process of a LCE and the subsequent thermo-mechanical deformations of LCE hemisphere are simulated using the commerical finite element software, Abaqus. The elastomer is modelled as a shell and is discretized using 3 or 4 noded shell elements (S3 and S4R) while accounting for the geometric non-linearity. Pressure-type loads are implemented to simulate the effect of vacuum generation on one face of LCE and also to model the forces on a LCE bowl filled with water. The simulations are presented in the article "Vacuum thermoforming of switchable liquid crystalline elastomer spherical actuators".
